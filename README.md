# Phylogenetica
Hi, my name is Maarten Dankers and this is the code for my bachelor final project about recreating phylogenetic trees can be found here.
This code is expanded upon from the code made by W. Sonke who's original code can be found here https://sourceforge.net/projects/fylogenetica/
Most of my contribution can be found in the inference folder, where my code for creating inference rules can be found as well as the file of all inference rules found so far.
But also a lot of contributions are in speeding up the dense vector calculations as well as expanding some concepts to work with these inference rules.
I have done this bachelor end project at Eindhoven University of Technology under the supervision of R. Pendavingh.
